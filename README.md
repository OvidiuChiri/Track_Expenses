# Track_Expenses
Graphical User Interfeace(GUI) based Expense Tracker application with Tkinter, Tkcalendar, and SQLite libraries in Python.

## Appendix.
Expense Tracker is a application allowing users to record their money inflow and outflow accurately.
This project build an Expense Tracker based on GUI in Python.
Tkinter, Datetime and SQLite come as preinstalled modules in Python.
However, we require installing the Tkcalendar using the PIP installer.
In Python we will create an empty folder named Expense Tracker and in this folder we will create a Python file as "main.py",
where we write the entire code.
1. Step 1: Importing modules.
2. Step 2: Creating the database and defining function to manipulate the data.
3. Step 3: Connecting to the database and creating the main window of the app.
4. Step 4: Adding widgets to the window and setting the events.
